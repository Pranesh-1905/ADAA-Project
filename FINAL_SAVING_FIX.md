# 💾 PERSISTENCE & RENDERING FIXED

## ✅ **1. Saving Charts**
I enabled **Database Persistence** for your custom charts.
- **Previously:** Charts were only stored temporarily in memory (lost on reload).
- **Now:** Charts are saved to the server/database securely. You can reload the page and they will be there.

## ✅ **2. Viewing Charts**
I fixed the "blank image" issue.
- **Interactive:** Custom charts now render as **interactive Plotly graphs** in your gallery. You can hover, zoom, and pan.
- **Full Screen:** Clicking a chart opens it in a full-screen interactive view.

## 🚀 **Verify Now**
1.  Create a new Custom Chart.
2.  Click **Create Chart**.
3.  It will appear in the specific "Visualizations" grid.
4.  **Reload the page**. It will still be there!
