# 🤝 COLLABORATION UPDATE

## ✅ **Removed Version History**
I have updated the **Collaboration Tab** to remove the Version History pane.
- Now, the tab focuses exclusively on **Comments & Discussion**.
- The layout has been simplified to give more space to the conversation view.

## 🚀 **Verify Now**
1.  Open an analysis result.
2.  Go to the **Collaboration** tab.
3.  You will see only the Comments panel, clean and focused.
